                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
  Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
  and change free software--to make sure the software is free
  for all its users. This General Public License applies to
  most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any
  other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other
  Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU
  Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
  your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
  not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of
  free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
  that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
  new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
  forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
  surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to
  certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies
  of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
  whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
  all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they,
  too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
  them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
  software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you
  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
  software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
  certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty
  for this free software. If the software is modified by
  someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know
  that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
  introduced by others will not reflect on the original
  authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
  patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
  free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in
  effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we
  have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
  everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
  and modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
  may be distributed under the terms of this General Public
  License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program
  or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either
  the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion
  of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
  is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
  are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
  output from the Program is covered only if its contents
  constitute a work based on the Program (independent of
  having been made by running the Program). Whether that is
  true depends on what the Program does.

[...]

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
 free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
 write to the author to ask for permission. For software
 which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write
 to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
 for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
 preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
 software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
 generally.

                 NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
 NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
 THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
 PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
 EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
 PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
 PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
 TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER
 PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
 PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
 ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
 (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
 OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
